This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly.

Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true`. For more information on current density usage, see http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html"

        summary="Looks for text fields missing `inputType` or `hint` settings"
        explanation="Providing an `inputType` attribute on a text field improves usability because depending on the data to be input, optimized keyboards can be shown to the user (such as just digits and parentheses for a phone number). Similarly,a hint attribute displays a hint to the user for what is expected in the text field.

The lint detector also looks at the `id` of the view, and if the id offers a hint of the purpose of the field (for example, the `id` contains the phrase `phone` or `email`), then lint will also ensure that the `inputType` contains the corresponding type attributes.

If you really want to keep the text field generic, you can suppress this warning by setting `inputType=&quot;text&quot;`."
